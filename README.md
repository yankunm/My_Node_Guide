# Yankun's Node Guide

[The Official Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/documentation.html)

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime. **ECMAScript** (first appeared 1997) is the standard that browsers implement so we can write JS in browser. 

In this guide we explore the basics of Node.

#### Client-Side vs Server-Side JavaScript

**Node is an implementation of JavaScript that runs outside of the browser**. When we write JS in browser, we are writing *client-side JavaScript*. We can now write *server-side JavaScript*, apps that not only work in browser but works **natively**. **NASA** use node, **Netflix** use node, **Uber** use node, almost everyone use node, so it is important to master it.

With Node, we can build:
* Web Servers
* Command Line Tools
* Native Apps (e.g. VSCode, Slack)
* Video Games (e.g. Cross-Code)
* Control drones, electric cars

Node is JavaScript, however it does not have browser stuff like window, document, DOM API, etc.
